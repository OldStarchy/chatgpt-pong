A game of pong (mostly) written by ChatGPT

I asked ChatGPT to write a game of pong.

You can [view the transcript](https://oldstarchy.github.io/chatgpt-pong/create-pong-game-html-js.html) and/or [see the game in action](https://oldstarchy.github.io/chatgpt-pong/).

There were a few things that needed fixing, eg. initially the game was white-on-white making everything invisible, but with a bit of hand-holding and some help in the `checkCollisionWithPaddle` function we got something working.
